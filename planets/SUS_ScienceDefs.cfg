                EratoInSpace = The atmosphere of Hecate was found to be very, very cold indeed. The ground looks very cold and possibly frozen. It also appears one side is more ice covered then the other. You mark down the landmasses in your report.
                FragumInSpace = It's funny, it looks like a big strawberry.
                EosInSpace = Blue and cracked, the ice sphere shines a hypnotic blue.
